<h1 align="center">Udon: Efficient Debugging of User-Defined Functions in Big Data Systems with Line-by-Line Control</h1>

<img src="core/new-gui/src/assets/logos/full_logo_small.png" alt="texera-logo" width="96px" height="54.5px"/> Udon builds on top of Texera, a collaborative data analytics workflow system.

## Udon instruction

Please follow [Guide to Develop Texera](https://github.com/Texera/texera/wiki/Guide-for-Developers) to install the
Udon-enabled Texera, enabling Python UDF.

## Udon components

### Two-thread execution model
Udon executes Python UDFs with a two-thread model.

- [Data processing thread](https://github.com/Texera/Udon/blob/master/core/amber/src/main/python/core/runnables/data_processor.py)
- [Control processing thread](https://github.com/Texera/Udon/blob/master/core/amber/src/main/python/core/runnables/main_loop.py)

Udon manages the integrated debugger with
a [DebuggerManager](https://github.com/Texera/Udon/blob/master/core/amber/src/main/python/core/architecture/managers/debug_manager.py).
There are the following configurations:

| Parameter name              | Type | Default Value | Usage                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| PAUSE_ON_HITTING_BREAKPOINT | Bool | False         | Let the debugger halt the execution when hitting a breakpoint. |
| PAUSE_ON_SETTING_BREAKPOINT | Bool | False         | Let the debugger halt the execution when a new breakpoint is set. |
| OP1_ENABLED                 | Bool | False         | Enables OP1, to hot-swap UDF code                            |
| OP2_ENABLED                 | Bool | False         | Enables OP2, to pull up predicates                           |

### SingleBlockingIO
The customized IO that supports:
-Transferring one message at a time, from producer to consumer.
-Blocking readline() when no message is available.
-Whenever being blocked, it switches between producer and consumer.

With the `SingleBlockingIO`, we achieved the context switch between the control processing (aka, `main_loop`) and data processing threads.

### Debug-related Messages (Command and Event)
- `DebugCommand`: a message from the user to the debugger, instructing an operation in the debugger, expecting no response from the debugger.
- `DebugEvent`: a message from the debugger to the user, which could be a reply to a DebugCommand or an event triggered in the debugger (e.g., hit a breakpoint, exception).

### Debug Command and Debug Event Life Cycle
The global picture of the debug-related messages exchange life cycle is shown below:

## Play with Udon (in production)


Udon supports actual control messages from the controller, which requires the user to manually input debug comments from
the Python UDF console. 

***

## Play with Udon (for experiments)
For demonstration and experiment purposes, we simulate debug instructions inside the control
processing thread. We provided a method `simulate_debug_command` to send arbitrary debug command to the target Python
UDF worker.

### pdb debug commands

Example to add a `setting breakpoint` command at line 20 of the UDF code, with some conditions:

```python
# in main_loop.py:127
self.simulate_debug_command(
    "b 20, 'Udon' in tuple_['text'] and 'welcome' in tokens"
)
```

Udon supports all [pdb commands](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=pdb+commands&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
except
for [`jump`](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=pdb+commands&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), [`interact`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-interact)
and [`quit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-quit).

### Additional debug commands

In addition to the standard debug commands, Udon also supports state transfer commands, including `ss` (store
state), `rs` (request state), and `as` (append state).
Example to add a `request state` command at line 20 to request the upstream Python worker's state at line 22:

```python
# in main_loop.py:132
self.simulate_debug_command(
    "rs 20 22 tokens "
    "PythonUDFV2-operator-8c277eca-adb7-4b4f-866c-3e8950535ef1-main"
)
```
For active transfer:
- AppendState. `as lineno state_name` Append the line state specified by the state lineno and state name to downstream operators.

For passive transfer:
- StoreState. `ss lineno state_name` Store the line state specified by the state lineno and state name for future reference.
- RequestState. `rs lineno state_lineno state_name target_worker_id` Request the state specified by the state lineno and state name from the target upstream worker, when processes to lineno.
